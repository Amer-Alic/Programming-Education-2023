## Objectives:

1. **Teaching Approach:**

We are proud to announce that all three goals have been successfully achieved.

## Achievements:

  - To date, 12 classes have been conducted, with an additional 3 scheduled for the future.

- **Student Progress:**
  - All students have mastered the basics of programming and are well-equipped to apply their knowledge in future initiatives.

- **Humanitarian Contribution:**
  - The funds collected from registrations were donated to the humanitarian organization "Merhamet."

- **Initiative Continuation:**
  - Importantly, the initiative to continue holding such training programs in the future on a larger scale has been successfully realized.

Thank you for your support and participation!
