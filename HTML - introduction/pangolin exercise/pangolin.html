Pangolin

Intro

Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from the ancient Greek φολῐ́ς,
"horned
shell"). One extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus, and Smutsia. Manis consists of four species
which are found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, which are all found in sub-Saharan
Africa. These
species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). Several extinct species of pangolin are also known.

Description

Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales that cover their skin; they are the only known mammals with this
feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
consists of
mainly from ants and termites, which they catch with their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, they date
only for mating and give a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years.

Poaching

Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine) and
large
deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most traded mammals in the world. From January 2020, from eight
pangolin species, three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as critically endangered, three
(Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are listed as endangered, and two (Phataginus
tetradactyla and Smutsia) are listed as v. List of endangered species of the International Union for Conservation of
Nature.
