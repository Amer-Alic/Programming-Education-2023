    The <b>BMW M4</b> is a version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by
    BMW motorsport division, BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of
    the renumbering that splits the coupé and convertible variants of the 3
    Series into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced the BMW M3 coupé and convertible
    models. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded
    engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures
    including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car.

    one of my favourite, and believe me, there are many of models I love. Here
    are some pictures of the BMW-s :
