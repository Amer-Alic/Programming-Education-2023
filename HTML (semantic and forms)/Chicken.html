        <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
            Southeast
            Asia.
        <p>They have</p> also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
        Ceylon
        junglefowl,
        and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel.
        A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female
        is
        called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as
        pets.

    Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
    domesticated
    for
    meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>



    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
    numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.s
