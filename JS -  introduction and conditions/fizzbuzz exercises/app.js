// Write a program that takes user input and prints numbers from
// one to the number entered by the user.
// However, for numbers divisible by 3, print Fizz instead of the number,
// and for numbers divisible by 5, print Buzz.
// For numbers that are divisible by both three and five, print FizzBuzz.
